# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
The purpose of this analysis is to help Alphabet Soup predict where to make investments with our knowledge of machine learning and neural networks.  We used features from the dataset to create a binary classifier that can help us predict if an applicant will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results: 

### Data Preprocessing
-The features for our model are "IS_SUCCESSFUL"

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluting the Model
- There are 8 nueurons in layer 1 and 5 in layer 2
- There are 2 layers
- The activation function we used was sigmoid becasue the sigmoid function values are normalized to a probability between 0 and 1, which is ideal for binary classification

## Summary: 
A possible different approach could be to use the ReLU function because it is good for looking at positive nonlinear input data for classification.
